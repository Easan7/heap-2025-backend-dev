This repo is used in the HEAP 2025 workshop on Backend Development

## Setting up the development environment

If you have the GitHub Student Development Pack from the SDLC, Git and Prototyping Workshop on 16th May 2025, you can use GitHub CodeSpaces to set up a clean development environment immediately.

If you prefer to work locally, please ensure that you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) Select the **LTS** version
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) If you are using other editors, we will provide limited support
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) Skip if you are comfortable working with the command-line

## Post Backend Workshop

After this workshop, you may want to delete all node_modules to save space. You can do this by running the following command in the root of this repository:

```bash
node delete-node_modules.js
```

And if you want to try the workshop again, you can run the following command in each section, to install all the dependencies again:

```bash
npm install
```
